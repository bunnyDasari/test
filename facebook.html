      ➡ Facebook is an American online social media and social networking
      service owned by Meta Platforms. Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with
      fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew
      McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face
      book directories often given to American university students. Membership
      was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other
      North American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As
      of 2020, Facebook claimed 2.8 billion monthly active users,[2] and ranked
      fourth in global internet usage.[6] It was the most downloaded mobile app
      of the 2010s.

    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">Step 1: Pass the resume screening</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      ➡ The first part of Facebook’s hiring process is, similar to most
      corporate jobs, resume screening. In this round, recruiters will screen
      your resume for technical requirements, education, experience,.. to make
      sure you’re a potential fit.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">
      Step 2: Pass the phone screenings (1-2 rounds)
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      ➡ In the recruiter phone screening round, which lasts 20 minutes, an HR
      recruiter will contact you to ask a few questions on the phone. These
      questions are somewhat behavioural, aiming to reveal your background
      information and qualities, from which the recruiter will assess your fit
      for the selected role
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      ➡ If you pass this initial phone screening, the recruiter will match you
      with a Facebook engineer to conduct the technical phone screening, which
      lasts around 45 minutes. You’ll be asked some questions pertaining to your
      resume for 10-15 minutes, then spend the next 30 minutes completing one or
      two coding questions (e.g. data structures, algorithms, etc) on a simple
      online code editor (e.g. CoderPad).
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">
      Step 3: Pass the on-site interviews (4-5 rounds)
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      ➡ Once you’ve passed the phone screenings, you’ll move on to the tough
      on-site interviews. In a typical on-site interview, you will be
      interviewed with another 4-5 people for 45 mins each. On-site interviews
      usually consist of 4-5 rounds, in which two things will be assessed: (1)
      Your fit for the selected role (role-specific fit) and (2) Process,
      teamwork, and culture fit (firm-specific fit).
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      ➡ For technical roles, there are generally two types of interviews you
      should be aware of: Coding on-site interviews and System Design on-site
      interviews. For each type, expect 2 or more interviews.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      Coding on-site interviews involve whiteboarding solutions to slightly
      harder data structures and/or algorithmic problems. The lesser experienced
      you are, the more number of coding onsite interview rounds for you.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      ➡ System Design Onsite interviews involve coming up with high level design
      architectures for real life products. The more experienced you are, the
      more number of these interviews you might face.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      ➡ For both technical and non-technical roles, you’ll definitely get
      teamwork/process/culture fit interviews. The fit interview will be a
      combination of topics ranging from agile methodology or workflow, teamwork
      and collaboration, and conflict resolution.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">
      Step 4: Pass the hiring committee reviews and get the offer
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      ➡ Congratulations! You’ve passed the on-site interviews, the toughest part
      of the interview process. At this point, candidates will be assessed in
      candidate review meetings, where team leaders/ managers will determine
      whether you’re a good fit for their respective teams. If a team wants you,
      they’ll tell your recruiter and it will be added to your portfolio, which
      will then be submitted to the hiring committee
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      ➡ After that, your performance will be evaluated by a hiring committee
      consisting of Facebook seniors. This step is usually a formality. Before
      the hiring committee session, each reviewer often takes hiring
      recommendations made in the candidate review meetings, which will be
      discussed during the session. If all members agree on one recommendation,
      an offer will be extended.
